"""
Functions that perform fourier transform processing, both Image->Visibility (predict) and Visibility->Image (
invert). In  addition there are functions for predicting visibilities from Skycomponents.

For example::

    model = create_image_from_visibility(vt, cellsize=0.001, npixel=256)
    dirty, sumwt = invert_2d(vt, model)
    psf, sumwt = invert_2d(vt, model, dopsf=True)

The principal transitions between the data models are:
